# Access Control Lists

NeoFS uses Access control information from three different sources:

- Basic ACL \
  Included into container structure
- Extended ACL \
  Stored in sidechain
- Bearer Token \
  Attached to request

## Basic ACL

Basic ACL is a part of the container structure. It's set at container creation
time and can never be changed, as containers are immutable.

Basic ACL covers most of the users' needs in simple access controls.



BasicACL checks must be computationally cheap




## Extended ACL

## Bearer Token
